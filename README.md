This project tries to record some works made by writer, which is mainly about liver cancer classification.
DCAH-Net is presented in My_model.py to grade hepatocellular carcinoma histopathological images. The detail of this model will be published soon.
For better experimental results, we strongly recommend researchers to train their models using pre-trained parameters from ImageNet. Some layers in the model can use pre-trained parameters, and better experimental results can be obtained by loading these pre-trained parameters.
